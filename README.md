I am a system programming and low-level enthusiast experienced with a variety of programming languages. I am proficient in C, C#, and currently exploring Zig. I have also used Go, Python, Rust, Ruby on Rails, and Flutter.

**Working on:**
- [Lavandula](https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/lavandula) - A C-based web framework
- [Zython](https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/zython) - A Python VM and interpreter written in Zig
- [Toon-Zig](https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/toon-zig) - The Zig implementation of TOON format

I enjoy working with compilers, programming language design, system software, and making things performant while retaining simplicity.
